Background
As a child, Parona often played with her elder sister, who took her into the forest one day and had her play an innocent game of hide and seek. She claimed the game would end once she returned, and promised to make Parona a new doll as a reward, leaving her with enough food to last a couple of days. However, Parona came out of hiding after about a week and asked for the whereabouts of her sister, only to be told that she was no longer there, chosen as a sacrifice to the Spirit Bear Oniguma. Consequently, Parona was admonished by the villagers for evading her role as a sacrifice and exiled from her home, and not long after, she found her sister's corpse lying deep in the forest.

Parona eventually found her way to another village, becoming close with a very young March after gifting a doll of her own make. From then on, she would regularly "play house" with her and create more dolls over the course of their friendship.
